# SECV1113-01--Festival-Project
This project is developed for the course SECV1113 – Computer Graphics (Semester 2, 2024/2025), with the aim to implement 2D transformation, interpolation, and graphic drawing using C++ and the graphics.h library.

Our team chose the theme Hari Raya Aidiladha, also known as Eid al-Adha, which is celebrated by Muslims worldwide as a commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim’s (A.S) devotion and willingness to sacrifice.
